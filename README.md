## Perpule Assignment
Create an application to find the route between locations.

1) Select source and destination (Preferably use google location search APIs).
2) Use google direction API
(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/) to find the directions
from the selected source to destination. List the waypoints (use icons, driving
instructions, custom stylings etc. to make it intuitive) (Optional: draw it on the map)
